# claude-code-containers

This repo is for sharing various Docker setups designed to provide some useful out-of-the-box easy-install environments for experimenting with Claude Code and living _dangerously_ (but inside a cozy container). Hoping to make it easier for people newer to software development and who don't care to learn about Docker to still practice their vibes and not get pwned. ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€

## Containers

- `node-python-basic` - more or less a minor extension of the Claude Code [reference container](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/devcontainer), but with better support for Pythonistas (the reference container firewall blocks PyPI), and automatically copies over your project's `CLAUDE.md`/`.claude/` as well

## Repo Structure

- `./containers` - contains appropriately-named directories which have a README and a `.devcontainers` folder tailored for more specific use cases.

## Roadmap

- [ ] More containers.

- [ ] Add a CLI that allows users to set up and configure their containers without having to touch the `.devcontainer` files.

## Context

Vibe coding tools are bringing a lot of new folks into the fun world of staring at your computer all day. Docker can be a little intimidating and may have a learning curve that, for many people, makes it such that they'd rather "yolo" until their data gets "yeeted". So, just trying to provide some things to make the ecosystem a little safer. (awww)

## Contributing

This is kind of a hobby project at the moment, but if you have a devcontainer setup that's perfect for doing X and want to share it here, feel free to open up a PR.
